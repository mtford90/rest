**WARNING:** Siesta has undergone huge changes in the last few weeks whilst in use in a large project. A new version will be released in the next few weeks addressing many issues and shortcomings and is rapidly catching up with the documentation. (Siesta is documentation-driven).

Any comments or feedback on the docs would be hugely appreciated - you can get involved via the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/mtford90/siesta) chat above. I WILL respond to comments.

Old versions can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/mtford90/siesta/releases) but at the time of writing the last version is 187 commits behind.

Watch this space!
